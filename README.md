# automateUBPX for UBP Xcellerator Courses

Made and tested using the Blockchain Development Program on Firefox.
I made this as I don't like the video player they used and the inconsistent video naming scheme. It also saves the video URLs to a text file so you can copy and paste them and download them with a download manager for offline viewing. It was made in a short amount of time that works for my use case.
